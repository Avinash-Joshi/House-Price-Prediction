# House-Price-Prediction

This is my internship task from technohacks 
I used dataset from kaggle and use jupyter notebook as code editor
I use python programming language and ML linear regression model to predict house priice with the help of independent variables

I first apply data cleaning and remove all the null values 
Remove the unnecessary columns on which our howse price is not much dependent.
I convert categoricaly values to integer 
Then I scale the data
my model scores 88%

After this there is test file too to predict the house price
